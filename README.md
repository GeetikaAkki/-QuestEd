## Problem Statement
Engineering students face numerous challenges that hinder their academic success and personal growth. These include:

- **Lack of Personalization:** Traditional learning methods fail to adapt to individual learning abilities and paces.
- **Overwhelming Content:** Managing the vast volume of technical coursework is a struggle for many students.
- **High Dropout Rates:** Academic pressure contributes to a significant number of students discontinuing their studies.
- **Limited Peer Interaction:** Students lack adequate opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing.
- **Neglect of Mental Health:** Stress and burnout affect students' academic performance and overall well-being.

### Gap in Existing Solutions

**For Students:**
- Absence of tools that adapt content difficulty to individual skill levels (easy, medium, hard).
- Lack of integrated support for student well-being.

**For Teachers:**
- Limited platforms for sharing quality educational resources.
- No feedback mechanisms to help refine teaching methods.

**The Need:**
A platform that personalizes learning, fosters peer collaboration, gamifies engagement, and promotes student well-being.

## Proposed Solution
QuestEd is an ed-tech platform designed to simplify learning for engineering students while supporting teachers. It includes two dedicated portals:

1. **Student Portal**
   - Students take an initial test to assess their knowledge and receive personalized courses and quizzes at three levels: easy, medium, and hard.
   - Features include:
     - Study materials in PDF format and embedded videos.
     - Gamification elements like badges for completing courses and quizzes.
     - A dashboard for tracking progress.
     - A calendar displaying daily quizzes and schedules.
     - Subject-specific chats for peer interaction and knowledge sharing.
     - Real-time monitoring of student well-being through facial recognition, offering health tips.

2. **Teacher Portal**
   - Teachers can:
     - Upload educational resources, such as videos and PDFs.
     - Access pre-existing materials to enhance teaching.
     - Track student performance and engagement.

### How It Solves the Problem
- **Personalization:** Adaptive courses and quizzes cater to individual abilities, reducing overwhelm and boosting engagement.
- **Content Management:** Organized topics with progress tracking ensure manageable learning.
- **Retention:** Gamified features and personalized learning paths enhance confidence and reduce dropout rates.
- **Well-Being Support:** Health tips and stress management suggestions foster balanced learning.
- **Teacher Empowerment:** Streamlined resource sharing and access to analytics improve teaching strategies.
